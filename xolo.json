Superb display in this segment.<br>\n2. Good battery backup(it looks like stock android only) <br>\n3. Not much apps running in background like samsung due to which XOLO q1000 is LAG free.<br>\n4. All apps can be moved to SD card so storage is not a problem.<br>\n5. Camera is good.(can record 1080p videos).<br>\n6. A must app XOLO POWER increases the battery backup to 40% more.<br>\n7. U can play almost all games(i have played NFS most wanted, NOVA 3, ASPHALT 8, DEAD TRIGGER 2, FIFA and much more heavy games)<br>\n8. once it fall down from my roof(around 15 feet) still it survived (though i got some scratches on back side), thats the build quality of the phone.<br>\n<br>\nCons:<br>\n1.

It is thin and sleek. Must handle it with care as it has a slight tendency to slip.<br>\nThe box contents are shipped in the same colour as that of the phone. There is a scratch guard included in the box content. Take care in applying it. The scratch guard are seldom available in the market.<br>\nThe 5 inch HD display is sharp and brilliant. The touch sensitivity is great.<br>\nMy Xolo Q1000 was shipped with android 4.2.1.<br>\nThe HDR picture and full HD video clarity of the rear camera is very decent. The front camera also looks good with the BSI sensor. The camera button of the phone is placed in the wrong spot because while pressing the button the camera lens and the flash is blocked. The projection on the rear camera can scratch its glass while placed on a non smooth surface. I would recommend a smooth pouch instead of a case for the phone to protect the rear camera glass.<br>\nThe costumer care call centre of Xolo is not satisfactory.<br>\nDo not complain for battery backup if you are a hard user. If you are a average user, you will be surely satisfied with the battery backup.<br>\nIt would have been better if the phone had a compass.<br>\n<br>\nPros:<br>\nDisplay<br>\nTouch sensitivity<br>\nThin and sleek<br>\n<br>\nCons:<br>\nCamera button<br>\nRear camera projection<br>\nCostumer care call centre<br>\nLacks a compass                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    nothing is good...... no service nothing.... if negative is there i will rate negative.... i don have worst worrds to explain.... please dont buy this mob......                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I m a xolo user and its hardware is a big problem.<br>\nWhen you look at this phone, it gives you a premium image and you feel the build quality also great.<br>\nHowever, problem begins any time. For me it started with in 3 months.<br>\n- Ear piece stopped working. I mean I could not hear to anything spoke to me, however loud speaker worked. Took the phone to dealer from i bought it. He asked me to contact XOLO care and then do accordingly. Kept trying XOLO care and finally logged a complaint. But no response what so ever! Then went to a care center on CMH road, Indiranagar, Bangalore to give it out for repair. Ended up figuring out that place was just a collection center and repair would happen somewhere else. To my surprise there 4-5 people more with XOLO phones with different models who had exactly same problem as I had. This gave me enough indications that XOLO phones have their hardware bad.<br>\nThen I asked how long would it take to get it repaired and got know that minimum 10 days!. Mind it minimum 10 days!!! There was another customer standing there who was disgusted, and informed that his mobile is in service center from last one month!!!!<br>\nThen immediately decided that I will get it reparied outside and got the speaker thing fixed outside for 1000/-<br>\nNow, I have issue with GPS. GPS is not working!!!. Keeps searching for ever!!!<br>\nSo, no more XOLO phones again, Sorry XOLO guys, you just suck                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I love this phone when its come first time in my hand. Look is great and its performance is amazing. i am using this phone for about 4 months and i don't find a single lag or hang till now.Very little lag when heavy games like Frontline Commando playing.                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Bang for ur buck (in terms of hardware). I have been using this for 4 months, bought thru _bay.in. Running multiple apps in parallel is just a breeze. My last phone was LG P500 - excellent hardware, on which I was still running Android 4.2 without issues :-)<br>\n<br>\nQ1000 has(or rather HAD) issues. Of the two SIM cards, one stopped working which needed an occasionally reboot - or swapping of the two sims to different slot(only one SIM had 3g data, was a pain). Random reboot once in 2 months. Lost the default launcher, keyboard settings on every reboot (v.v.annoying for me) and lock screen was not customizable(ie, adding music player widget or message widgets on the lock screen), FM radio reception was fluctuating and had a below average camera software with a bad auto focus.<br>\n<br>\nNow for the reason I am giving it 4 stars:<br>\n1. Build quality very good. After dropping a few times, only minor scratches on back cover. Wifi and 3g speeds are blazing fast, bluetooth works. BEAUtiful screen, simply awesome. Earphones are OK, Viper/AC!D audio engine (ACID break video recording) etc makes audio an amazing experience. Camera is decent (stock camera app and stock ROM are crappy), auto-focus speed is an issue. Graphics is awesome, video playback is very very good (but i don't play much games, so cant comment about battery life). In general, with moderate to heavy use, battery lasts a day and a half.<br>\n2. Most of the issues were solved by software and custom ROMs. This hardware is the same as Cherry mobile Omega HD 2.0 of Philippines. There is a very active Facebook page with a lot of custom development happening for this hardware. I was able to root it easily. I have been running various custom ROMs - galaxy s4, s4 mini, hdc s4, miui. About to test the xperia Z1 and Lewa OS. Very happy with the Lenovo super camera and super gallery applications.<br>\n<br>\nAlso have a Q800 in the family, no issues there either. XOLOs choice of hardware is good. Software is simply crappy. As for their after sale support, touchwood, thank god, insha alla, I have not had the need for them yet. As close you can get to S4 at this price.<br>\n<br>\nUpdate: Using it now for over a year now. This phone has seen quite a few falls - few dents and metallic rim damaged at a few places. I didn't put on screen guard after first 2-3 months or use - screen is STILL pristine thanks to the dragon tail glass. My last three custom ROMs(kitkat based) gave good boost to available RAM. CPU and GPU still going strong, though battery is at the end of its life. The glass on the back camera has developed scratches due to my rough usage. As good a new gen phone quadcore CPU like MTK 6582, better in some areas.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    high on features but the navigation present is not good , the lack of magnetron sensor makes it inaccurate........                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I had purchased a XOLO X900 for Rs 17500 in the month of November 2012, with a one year guarantee, suddenly in the month of May I started facing network issues, against which I tried contacting the customer care, I had to call for more than 50 time just to get my Cell phone picked up for repair, Finally After 20 days of continuous call ans series of mails the handset got picked up from my address, and was sent to Delhi Service centre. As per there company policy i was suppose to get my hand set back after 5 working days, but i waited for 20 long days, I got my ph. Back, when I received it, I discovered that the problem was not resolved and they had sent it back to me in the same condition, I decided to keep quite for a month, I decided to came down to Bangalore, thought i would personally go get it repaired, and so i did, i made a ph. Call to the customer care took another complain no. and dropped my handset in the service centre myself as on 12/9/2013 , after a month they say that we cannot do anything about it, as the company has stopped manufacturing the network censors. So the offered me for a refund of Rs. 10000 or other handset worth 11300. IS it the costomers fault or the companies fault, why do I have to bare the loss for company, now the company is doing nothing but cheating people, if they knew there is some defect with the handset then why did they choose to sell it in the stores??? Its been more than 6 months that i have been facing the trouble.                                 </span>"]},

My Xolo went dead in just around 25 days and to get it repaired, I first had to call customer care number which got connected in half an hour after several tries and file a complaint. Then I had to send the device to a collection point around 25 Kms from my place. They will send the device to service centre which is 4 Kms from my place just because I cannot go directly to the service sentre. They claim to repair the handset in 5 days. Its 10 days now and there is still no update on the handset. They keep saying to wait for another 48 hours. If you want to buy a handset from such a company, then God Save You.

They will not treat you as a customer and keep redirecting between service centers and customer care. You will loose your time. I have xolo q1000 handset and I got battery problem. They took my battery for replacement and its been close to 2 months. I haven't got my batery. Just wasting my time.                                 </span>"]},

It takes 4-5 hours for complete charge (2100maH). Charger gets heated up on charging.<br>\n3. Output volume is low.<br>\n4. Auto Brightness adjustment is horrible.<br>\n5.

Video calling is a little bit disappointing factor.<br>\n8. Lack of good Customer Service.<br>\n9. Lack of Sensors.<br>\nPros:<br>\n1. Good  5 inch HD IPS LCD Capacitive Display. (no pixelation) 294 ppi.16.7 M Colours.<br>\n2. 1.2 GHz Quad Core MT6589 processor &amp; PowerVR SGX544 GPU is damn good.<br>\n3. Healthy 1GB RAM (640MB Usable). No lags.

Even if its a 5 inch phone its very Slim n perfectly fits in your palm. Most impressive part is the Display  which wont disappoint u.. Its Bright, Crisp and More Vivid.. A Good Display with very High Details.. This outlook Gives Q1000 a Premium Look.<br>\n<br>\nFor Performance Users:<br>\nohk.. Its Mediatek's 6589 Quadcore... i didn't try with loads of apps.. but it shouldn't give any lags even if u install 80+ apps with some always running in background and SGX 544 Graphics chip is not bad for Gaming ... You wont miss out your favorite Game.. i own Xolo A800 which has SGX 531 which is from the previous Generation of PowerVR series and i can Run all my favorite Games Properly. So, Graphics shouldn't create any problems in Gaming.<br>\n<br>\nFor Photographers:<br>\nIt does has 8MP cam and yes it does Shoot video in 1080p. But don't expect its Imaging like of Galaxy S3 or HTC ONE X+. Coz that can Disappoint u. 1080p video is not up to  mark...Sometimes Video gets blured. recording in 720p is only better. It gives  around 12,000 data rate &amp; 30 Frames per Second is enough for a good quality video output.<br>\n<br>\nStorage(Important for Gamers) :<br>\nInternal Flash storage is 1GB that's nice. u get only 2GB for phone Memory. Still When Installing very Big applications u wont have any problem, for SD card you may buy one nice 32GB class 10 Memory card and since it runs on Android Jelly Bean OS u may Swap it with your Phone Memory. so u can load as many Big Games or apps on ur Phone.<br>\n<br>\nAfter Sales Service:<br>\nSad but its True, as many have already said.. Xolo's Service really sucks... even on Xolo's Facebook Fan page they wont respond to you... They do respond to your Calls but it may be in vain. Still Fingers crossed. They are improving day by day. So i don't consider service as a Con.. <br>\n<br>\nOverall this phone can be a good buy at a price bucket of 15k, but it lacks a Magnetic Field Sensor. so compass app will act dumb when installed ;-) . Rest all assured.<br>\n<br>\ni rate it 4/5 as i am not satisfied with its Imaging capabilities. Imaging is same as Q800.                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I Waited for a long time to get Xolo Q1000 black colour and finally i got it.
