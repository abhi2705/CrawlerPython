The Back plastic cover is not fitting accurately to the phone and due to this, the loose end hits the SIM card and eventually the SIM comes out. I experienced this a lot of times and first I thought it was due to my bad SIM, but then when I talked about this to other Buyers, OMG ! they all faced the same problem.<br>\n<br>\nFlipKart - Do you have any idea about this? Please check this defect atleast in the next set of Phones you get from the Manufacturer !                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Hello Readers,<br>\n<br>\nThe overall performance and other aspects of this phone are excellent but there is one major flaw with the moto e back cover/shell design.<br>\n<br>\nIf you try to remove the cover multiple times, it will not fit complete into the phone and will come out a little bit.<br>\n<br>\nThis sounds a little cheap and I did not expect this from such a quality phone which is advertised as \"Build To last\"<br>\n<br>\nBeware, if you are going to buy multiple shells and flip them frequently then you are going to damage them after few days.. (and FYI shells cost Rs900 which is EXPENSIVE)                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Moto E is all set to be the gamechanger in the budget android phones battle. Here are the features and reasons you need to remember this for:<br>\n<br>\nPros:<br>\n1. For under 7000Rs, you get Corning gorilla glass, splash proof water resistant coating. Even samsung series mobiles that are close to 20000rs don't provide this. It seriously helps in reducing scratches and adds a premium look to the display as it is glass unlike the plastic covering that you come across in others.<br>\nThe BUILD QUALITY is the BEST HANDS DOWN!! Coming from an OEM manufacturer, the finishing and the quality of plastic used is way better than the 20000rs+ samsung phones.<br>\n<br>\n2. 1.2 ghz dual core processor, snap dragon 200, though slightly an older model processor, combine this with the 1gb RAM and be rest assured you have a butter smooth interface and browsing experience. AT THIS PRICE RANGE, 1.2GHZ, 1GB RAM, SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR WITH ADRENO 302GPU IS UNMATCHED!!!<br>\n<br>\nANDROID KITKAT V4.4 OUT OF THE BOX!!<br>\n<br>\n3. Since the display is covered over by glass (corning gorilla glass), it looks amazingly premium when you hold it in your hands compared to the plasticy looking samsungs and micromaxes.<br>\n<br>\n4. The qHD (540x960) display with 256ppi density is better than Samsung Galaxy Grand series mobiles which retails for around 18000+. and in real life too, the image reproduction is just unbelievably amazing.<br>\n<br>\n5. It also has adreno 302 400hz single core gpu, which can easily take on some of the high intensity games like FLcommander, latest angry birds, etc., though you will finds lags in the super high end games like NOVA 3 or asphalt 8 etc. but unlike the other phones in this range, it will be able to run the apps, but you cannot expect a lag free experience, but it still does the job when you reduce the graphics detail level.<br>\n<br>\n6. The camera: Only rear main camera. 5 mega pixels. No autofocus. No flash. Yet, this is more than sufficient as this phone proves to do a good job even in low light settings. Please note, there is no auto focus and tweaking the settings a little you can obtain grain free, fine quality pictures even in low light. It does take 720p videos at 30fps.<br>\n<br>\n7. The best feature, which even the moto G and X lacks: SD card support!!! expandable upto 32gb!!!. This more than makes up for the lack of OTG support. Please note 4gb of internal storage is given, out of which around 1.8gb will be already utilized for the android system. Expect around 2 to slightly less than 2gb of free internal storage. It is highly advised you book at least a 16gb sd card.<br>\n<br>\n8. The 1980mAh is sure as hell to last an entire day's usage. Please note the battery remains user not-removable as in the case of moto g and x. With a combination of heavy and moderate usage, it lasted easily for an entire day.<br>\n<br>\n9. It supports 3g, 2g, wi-fi connectivity. <br>\n<br>\n10. The speakers are in the front so it doesn't get blocked when you keep it face up on flat surfaces.<br>\n<br>\n11. Beautiful customizable back covers, you can make you own personal statement now. You can be sure of its quality coming from motorola themselves, much like the ones available with moto g.<br>\n<br>\nAll other sensors are standard with GPS, magnetometer, proximity sensor etc,.<br>\n<br>\nCONS:<br>\nAt this killer price, there is really no CONS to be added. Yet, let me point out to things that the Moto e is lacking compared to its elder sibling The moto g:<br>\n<br>\n1. Moto g has a snapdragon 400 quadcore, this is only dual core.<br>\n2. No led notification.<br>\n3. No flash for camera. No front facing camera!!!<br>\n4. No otg support.<br>\n5. Graphics not sufficient for really heavy and high end graphics intensive games like NOVA 3, Asphalt 3 etc., though they will run with less specifications on graphics detail.<br>\n<br>\nMOTO e is sure as hell built to last and a sure fire game-changer in the indian budget android market in INDIA!!<br>\n<br>\n                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Regardless of the quality of the device, which I'm sure is more than what the mass is expecting at this budget price point, I can see some people are busy reiterating the fact that \"you have not used it yet\", \"post reviews after so and so date, else your verdicts are fake\". I'm sure people were expecting this phone to be in the range of 8-9k and they were overwhelmed to see it at 6999, so most of the reviews here are posted because they couldn't help their excitement. I can understand it was their mistake or rather an accident they rated it 5 stars even when they haven't used it. Funny thing is I can't understand is why some of you rated it 1 or 2 stars cause you haven't used it as well! Or maybe you're repenting on your recent purchase which costed you more but maybe not as good as this one. Burn!<br>\n<br>\nAnd as for the phone goes, yeh toh micromax, lava aur xolo se behtar hi hoga (if you're keen on representing chinese made chipsets and build quality).. And I don't see any samsung or sony phone below the range of 10k compete with this hardware. <br>\n<br>\nWouldn't make comments on the performance or usability of the phone yet, I'm just getting ready to get my hands dirty on this one.<br>\n<br>\nReview after hands on 21st May -<br>\n<br>\nNow flipkart kind of ruined the whole party by delivering it so late, I just received it yesterday. Now, coming to the phone itself, the packaging was a bit flimsy but alright. I opened the box, and there lay Moto E, glistening with its gorilla glass 3 display, looked as good as a 15k device. Opening the back cover is a bit tricky, inserted 16GB micro sd and booted up. <br>\n<br>\nDisplay - You all know the specs of the display, it is as good as any you'll find in the price range of up to 15k (best in class). You can observe a bit of pixelation if viewed closely, but from a hands distance, it's sheer viewing pleasure. Movies of 720p play smooth, and even most 1080p videos are working fine in MX Player S/W mode. <br>\n<br>\nUI - Android Kitkat 4.4.2 out of the box, what better can you expect. Stock android feeling with a bit of motorola assistance and security tools to mark its signature on it. The wallpapers look great on this UI, and the experience is fluid even with multiple apps open. Haven't stressed out with gaming but I'm sure on normal usage it would suffice for most users with the hardware it comes with. Snapdragon 200 is pretty snappy and minus the customization of skins which brands like samsung and htc comes with, it is an added advantage. You won't feel compromised at all.<br>\n<br>\nResources &amp; Hardware - 1GB Ram and Adreno 302 will serve most tasks easily. The audio output is also decent, the same google play music app with sound enhancements of moto g is also available, so you are not missing out on anything. Gorilla Glass protection is handy for regular usage. With all apps installed you'll still get 400-450 MB of RAM free on most occasions and 350MB when you're using 5-6 apps simultaneously. There was very negligible lag.<br>\n<br>\nCamera - Bit of a letdown, some people will always complain because of the lack of flash and front snapper, but then again this is a different segment, if they put everything in here as they did on moto g then who will buy moto g? I'm not a fan of camera phones so this doesn't disappoint me. But I still think it does a decent job. <br>\n<br>\nBattery - I expected a little better, not that it lacks power. One full day will last under normal to medium high usage. I used it for two hours continuously with wifi on, downloading and installing apps, listening to music and playing videos. The battery lost 20% juice. So around 10 hours of active usage should be there approx.<br>\n<br>\nGaming - Don't expect heavy gaming, this doesn't even promise you that. But for casual gamers, it is your playground to exploit :)<br>\n<br>\nConclusion - If you want to buy a phone with a budget which doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. This one is for you. If you're in college who is going to buy his first android smartphone and want a premium experience at low cost, this one is for you. If you want to gift your parents or siblings a new phone who never used a smartphone before, this is what you should be going for. If you're a critic for not including HD recording and led flash or front cam, then you need to wait another 5-10 years till they launch iphone @ 10k, because this is NOT for you.                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    After using two weeks, I am not going to discuss specifications of the phone. I will tell you the real pro and cons of the phone.<br>\n<br>\nCons:<br>\n1. Camera : it is a nightmare when you need to take pictures of nearby objects like documents. Otherwise camera will work fine. My Rating 3/5<br>\n2. Heating Problem: Heats very much while playing games like Angry Birds. It is quite normal, but I feel it is overheating a little. 3/5<br>\n3. High SAR Value, Thrice to Samsung n Nokia Phone. A huge disappoint for me. Be assured that you will get headache if used for long period of time.(0/5)<br>\n4. I got a black phone with White color cheap headset. Produce crackling sound at high volumes. Rating 2/5<br>\n<br>\n5. Phone doesn't have a file manager, so be sure to install ES FIle explorer from playstore. Very small issure for me.<br>\n<br>\n6. ON 2 G connection Playstore starts downloading applications but stops in the middle, say after 1-2 Mb of download. You need to disable data and enable it again to resume downloading of app.  On wifi, it works fine.<br>\n<br>\nI have to download apks from other websites, because playstore was creating problems on 2G. 2G connection work very fine and stable.<br>\n<br>\nPros:<br>\n<br>\n1. Touch very responsive. Just like apple's . Auto correct feature is very nice if you are sending messages in English, otherwise you need to train it.(5/5)<br>\n<br>\n2. I installed Temple Run, Subway surfers, Candy Crush, Angry Birds, Moto Racing, No lag so far. Moved apps to SD cards easily.(5/5)<br>\n<br>\n3. Display : Best in class, no bad words(5/5). Got most compliments for its display and gorilla glass.<br>\n<br>\n4. Back cover doesn't feel cheap plastic but do not open it frequently otherwise it will get loose.<br>\n<br>\n5. Notification Light. Nice feature. Turned off by default. <br>\n<br>\n6. Finger print resistant (No). Water Resistant Yes, Water Proof- No, Scratch Resistant- upto some extent.<br>\n<br>\nFinal words<br>\n<br>\nFlipkart is creating hype for it, since in this segment,  Micromax , Lava etc are supplying a hardware only on Papers. They are well known for their non reliable, Ghatia Jugaad hardware.<br>\n<br>\nYou can go for it, actually wait for it, if you can NEGLECT HIGH SAR VALUE AND a useless camera for nearby objects.<br>\n<br>\nYou cannot take picture of documents, signatures , scan a barcode, QR Code  scanning will also get problem if another phone is small.<br>\n<br>\nI hope  you like my review.

(My first Motorola)<br>\n<br>\nI was going through the list of negative reviews of the phone (217! thats a big number) and decided Ito put forth my two penny or maybe because of insomnia (!) (yeah! at 2:30 am)<br>\n<br>\nI had ordered the phone (as many here did) at 12:00 am on 14th May. Initially I had faced the issue of payment when my account was debited but the confirmation did not come through. I promptly called the customer service and enquired about it to which I was replied that servers issues were there, so it will come through (yeah I got frustrated too, I had just paid 7000!). I waited and sure enough an hour later, the confirmation came through and I got the email (phew!) I had asked for a next day delivery so expected the delivery by 15th May, which happened (yeeaa..new phone!) Booted up the phone, read the spec sheet ( :/) and been using it since without any major glitch!<br>\n<br>\nLessons<br>\n1. Yes SAR value is high but still within permissible limits as prescribed, so don't worry your brain won't turn to jelly (that rhymed!)<br>\n2. GPRS works (duh!)<br>\n3. Has hotspot.<br>\n4. Back cover isn't loose as many have been saying, but that being said, faulty pieces may come up.<br>\n5. Camera sucks, I mean really sucks, its a 5 MP alright, but shooting has to be restricted in day or bright conditions only, but then please don't go comparing with a Micromax of Samsung phones of same price tag, at-least performs better than them, any of them, period. (Have used phones of only Samsung and Micromax in the past)<br>\n6. HD screen??? You guys need an HD screen for 7k?? really?? This phone has got a ppi of 256, isn't that good enough for you?<br>\n7. Heating issues? Didn't face any major heating issues while playing any game yet, minor yes. The only problem is it gets heated up during charging, especially the charger.<br>\n8. Some one compared Micromax something something.and XOLO something something....nope...don't have any words for you. Oh, fyi...motorola MAKES their phones, doesn't BRAND cheap Chinese ones.<br>\n9. Someone said the Moto E is a chinese phone, well done sir! You are right, it is indeed made in China. So is the phone, the laptop, the computer etc. you are using. China is the world's largest electronics manufacturing hub.<br>\n<br>\nFor lovers of this phone! You don't need a review, you know it!                                </span>"]}]
