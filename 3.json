Superb display. camera and battery backup is ok ok.. <br>\nI got it at a much better price than the market price and thanks to flipkart for that.

Happy with the performance of both flipkart (on entire buying process) as well as phone. Earlier i was using samsung note series but if i compare it with nexus 5, it is no where near the nexus league. This phone doesn't have any lag. Also, i am quite happy with the camera, as i have seen lot of reviews where people have critisized it alot. But it is same as 8m samsung phone. Infact front camera is better, bet on that.<br>\n<br>\nOnly drawback which i found is, its very delicate and it display glass is not as rigid as any other top market player. If it falls from your hand then be ready to shell out another 10k, personnal experience. Also, choose wisely between 16 and 32 GB. As 16 gb limits us on lots of stuff.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    The only problem I faced is battery  it does not last very long and some issues with network some time but barring this two things it is great phone to buy!!!                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    This is the best buy in sub INR 30,000 category.Period.<br>\n<br>\nThe whole package - hardware and the software - are tightly knit together. This is Android at it's sublime best. One could be excused from believing that Google Play store was custom built for NEXUS range on the lines of iTunes for Apple products. <br>\n<br>\nIt does all the tasks beautifully which 99% common people like me expect from a smart phone...some useful apps, music, videos. taking pictures, sharing files and stuff like that. The 4.95 inch screen and resolution is  wonderful...it fits nicely into your hand w/o having to do any jugglery act as with large screen phones.<br>\n<br>\nCamera could have been tad bit better (I've been a Nokia user :-)) but apps do make up somewhat for the short-fall.<br>\n<br>\nWith the price having gone down further, this is a wonderful device to have. Unless, you want to wait for NEXUS 6 or whatever Google chooses to call it.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Even every one agree this Nexus 5 is better than its costly rivals from samsung,LG,Sony .Mainly because of its price point,killer specs with very good build quailty.<br>\nWait until XIOAMI MI3 arrives.MI3 is a heck of a phone with killer specs and build quality with the price for 14k we can buy 2 phones equal to one nexus phone.<br>\nLet us wait and see how Nexus 5 will fare against the Juggernaut in form of MI3.                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I ordered Nexus 5 just 2 days before leaving for Germany and got it delivered the very next day. Thanks to flipkart's in a day guarantee. <br>\nNow, let's do some talking about the phone. <br>\nThis phone is a beauty in terms of design. The buttons are very well placed and one hand operation is very easy. The 4.97 inch LCD Display is ideal for everyday use. It's neither too small nor too large like the Lg G2. It' just perfect. The viewing angles are great and colours are just perfect. The mat finish at the back gives it a premium look. ( back just loves finger prints, so you'll see the fingerprint marks every now and then. Annoying. )<br>\nTalking about performance, this phone is a monster. 2.2 Ghz snapdragon 800 with pure vanilla android makes this phone flawless. It can handle any game with ease. <br>\nThe only problem is that battery drains fast. So, if you are a heavy user carry the charger along.  <br>\n <br>\nSumming up:<br>\nPROS:<br>\n-Great design<br>\n-Great performance<br>\n-Decent Camera<br>\n<br>\nCONS:<br>\n- Fingermarks catchy back.<br>\n- Average Battery Performance                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    The device is just awesome everyone is saying that there are problem with battery and camera. The battery run for about 1 day 3 hours and 23 mins on heavy usage. I have not faced any of the issues with device till now. The people were also saying that they are facing problems after updating to Android 4.4.4 but till now no issues after updating.<br>\n<br>\nHere are the pros and cons of the device.<br>\n<br>\nPros:<br>\n4.95-inch Full HD IPS Display<br>\nQualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor (the best processor for smartphones)<br>\n2GB RAM <br>\nFast performance<br>\nAndroid 4.4 KitKat upgradable to 4.4.4 (android L will also come first on this device after it officially releases)<br>\nGets Android update first as the device is maid by google<br>\nRich Android experience<br>\nAdreno 330 450MHz GPU for awesome gaming<br>\n8MP rear camera with LED flash (awesome image quality) with new HDR  mode and 1.3MP front camera<br>\nNFC support<br>\n16GB in-built storage (12.98GB user accessible)<br>\nWireless charging<br>\n3G  (4G is also supported in Indian models so do not need to worry. You will be able to use in coming years),<br>\n<br>\nCons:<br>\nNo secondary memory support<br>\nNo FM Radio support<br>\nHave issues with Wi-Fi connectivity but this problems occur sometimes and it is going to be fixes by Google with the upcoming Android update.<br>\n<br>\nI want people who are looking for an awesome smartphone in Rs.28,000 please keep a serious eye on this device as this is the best from Google in this range. I have been using this device from the last one week till now it is working smoother and faster as a new device works. Recommend this device to everyone who are looking for an amazing android experience. Also, the delivery was very faster as in my location in-a-day guarantee is not available but still got it it after 2 days of ordering. Amazing service from Flipkart and Google.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Flipkart delivery was superb. Using the nexus 5 since 1 month.  Amazing smartphone, no lag at all. Also got kitkat 4.4.3 update. Playing game on this smartphone also smooth. Games like real racing, fifa 14 works smooth not even minor lag. I recommend this smartphone to everyone.                                </span>"]},

I wouldn't go in length describing each and every feature of the phone as there are already a zillion reviews on the internet. It is definitely the best Nexus phone ever.<br>\n<br>\nJust go for it.

Nexus 5 has a bug where a demon thread which works for the camera keeps on working even camera is off. Hope it gets resolved in next update.<br>\nb) auto brightness of the phone works too well. it gives you more brightness than required , eventually draining your battery<br>\nc) the speaker sound is very clear but a bit low. could have been better.<br>\n<br>\nBut overall this phone is the best if you compare to other high-end phones.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    it is an awesome phone. it is so beautiful and has a very good battery life.<br>\nit has got amazing photo quality.<br>\nthis phone is just too good.<br>\ni dont regret buying it.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I just want to take a moment to say that this is by far the best phone made for a price range which is so attractive. It matches with or in-fact it downright beats most of the top notch high end phones  in the market in a  one to one match-up. The only problem I face is with the battery, It could have been better/long lasting.Few minor s/q glitches. Nothing that can't be fixed. Some s/w upgrades in the 4.4.3  will enhance the battery life and the camera focus quality  says Google. Can't wait for it.

Unlike my Nexus 4 which I needed to charge by 5-6PM after an overnight charge, my Nexus 5 is still at 30% at the end of the day. This is with constant wifi and a few phonecalls, plus bluetooth connectivity with my car's music system. I was pleasantly surprised by this.<br>\n<br>\n2. The screen is a step up too. I don't watch a lot of videos on my phone admittedly, but when I do, it feels a lot better than the Nexus 4.<br>\n<br>\n3. It's faster. Especially with the udpate to KitKat, my Nexus 4 had gotten visibly sluggish at certain points. The Nexus 5 on the other hand is extremely smooth to use and works like a charm.<br>\n<br>\n4. English (India) - I hadn't noticed this before, but there's now an English(India) option for the phone which refreshingly doesn't require me to pronounce the words as carefully as before when using voice search.<br>\n<br>\nCons:<br>\n<br>\n1. The speakers, while a step up from the Nexus 4, are still not great. That said, I don't use the speakers much anyway, so it's not a big deal for me.<br>\n<br>\n2. No micro SD slot. This means you're stuck with the space you have built-in. I just have a handful of songs (mainly for ringtones) as most of my music is on spotify. I haven't run into any issues with space but I can see this being a con for other people.<br>\n<br>\nOn the whole, this is a great phone at a good price.

Touch can be compared to that of apple.<br>\n<br>\ndowload radio and file manager when ever you buy.<br>\n<br>\nIn this range we have note2, s4, moto X but Nexus 5 stands tall with KITKAT ! :) Samsung all phone looks almost the same. <br>\n<br>\nGOOGLE ROCKS !                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    A beautifully crafted phone with v.few shortcomings.  The shortcomings are, no memory card, shorter capacity battery and a camera that struggles to focus in varying light condition and no FM radio.

Battery backup is about 12 hours (just as bad as most android phones)<br>\n2. Display is clear and big enough for you to enjoy videos<br>\n3. It will support most of the games you will want to play<br>\n4. Money wise too it is a good choice because it's config is very competitive compared to its modest pricing.<br>\n5. Speakers suck a bit but so much that you'll regretted buying the phone. <br>\n6. Camera is absolutely fine despite the reviews it got when the phone was released. The quality was fixed in an update which you'll get the moment you turn on your new phone.<br>\n7. Heating issue do exist. The phone tends to heat up when you are a playing a game for longer than 5-10 min and also when you are charging the phone.<br>\n<br>\nOverall impression is that its worth it. You'll never feel that you compromised on quality for price (as is the case with the Samsung S Duos which is really just garbage)                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I wanted to buy this phone on Flipkart but the phone was not available online and had to wait for long time before buying it, due to its limited availability in the beginning. But trust me the wait was worth it, coz when I saw this phone for the first time; it was love at first sight. The phone just looks beautiful with its black body finish.  The phone is extremely light weight compared to the bulky and huge phones available in the market nowadays. The best part of the phone is its display and processor. Unlike Samsung, that has a bluish color display, colors on Nexus look very rich and vibrant.  Watching movies and playing games is a treat. The phone has 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 Processor which makes the phone a superfast device and it does not lag irrespective the no of application running in background.  The camera of the phone is also awesome and captures beautiful images even in low light. And being a google phone running on the latest android version of kitkat, you will be the first one to get all the recent updates. Had heard some negative reviews about its battery life, but I have personally not faced any issues till now since the last one month of using this phone. In fact after charging my phone completely, the full battery lasts for the entire day with god amount of usage of playing games, listening to music, calls and etc. And not to forget that the battery of the phone gets full charged in an hour! With Samsung and other mobile phone companies launching their phone at 35K to 40K with similar specifications or less, Nexus 5 is worth every penny spent. So don\u2019t hesitate before buying this masterpiece, because you will never be disappointed.                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Guys I got nexus form Google India playstore.

To do a simple teset, turn on Wifi and open chrome and browse for 10-15 min and check the back panel. You will feel the heat and this is not expected from a Rs.29,000 phone.<br>\nI called up google and they asked to me return the phone and sent me a replacement. Even the replacement phone has this issue. Check with your friend, play a game, and if you play heavy games then you are dead. It heads up badly. <br>\nRest the phone is good but the heating problem bothers and even my samsung galaxy grand or my lumia 900 is better than Nexus 5.

Even 20 minutes and the phone gets noticeably warm , which is pretty bad considering that your battery power is being lost as heat  instead of being utilised to run the operations , Which means really inefficient circuitry   and electronics . <br>\n<br>\n                       Speaker phone   sounds jars at even 75  % volume   like a China Phone  that labourers and construction workers use .  Pathetic .

It suffers with horrible microphone quality along with other software glitches. I had such bad experience with this phone that i had to claim refund from flipkart.<br>\n<br>\nIssues: 1. When I picked up any call, caller was not able to hear me for 1st 2-3 seconds.<br>\n2. Sometimes callers were complaining that I sound as I am talking from a long distance. This is an epic problem with Nexus 5. Google a bit to know more.<br>\n3.Record video in a silent place and watch that video to know the hissing sound which goes even worse when records a voice.<br>\n<br>\nThese problems were not there when I used headphones.<br>\n<br>\nOther issue: 1. When i got call waiting and tried to pick up the second call...phone hangs and caller hears continuous ringing. This happens randomly.<br>\n2. During long hour calls..phone heats up and restarts automatically.<br>\n3. Mobile data does not connect unless phone is restarted once. <br>\n<br>\nGoogle has improved some of the bugs with update 4.4.2 but I don't know why they are ignoring microphone issues.

Having said that this is the first device to be running android 4.4, I must add that this is not only the first but also the best device you will get for a price range of 30k running Android Kitkat. The Hardware delivers smooth performance not just on Reviews, or Hands-Ons but in real time as well. This is a definitely thumbs up phone to go for.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I orderd the phone from Flipkart, I came to know that the phone is malfunctioning like:<br>\n<br>\n1. Hangouts SMS's are not getting updated immidietly, sometimes SMS sent are not at all displayed in hangouts.<br>\n2. While you are on call suddenly microphone stopped working, the next person on call unable to here you.<br>\n3. Camera stopped working at any point of time with error.<br>\n4. Hangs a lot many times.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I raised a complaint for returning it, the request got rejected saying \"seller rejected the request\".<br>\n<br>\nFeeling like cheated :(                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    1.

There are some complaints that the phone speaker doesnt work properly when you are in sleeping position or in a rocking chair but I did not face this problem too many times.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, it is a good purchase.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I have a very bad experience with Flipkart!<br>\n<br>\nThe day I purchased the product, it was 29182.  Within 2 days, the price fell to 27182.  When I spoke to customer care, they said that they have a policy that refunds the difference amount in the form of a promotion code within 3days.  I had to call the customer care multiple times to check the status of my request.  Every time they said, their sales team is working and confirmed that I will be getting the promotion code very soon.  However, after around 7days or so, I got a mail saying that I am not eligible for promotion code.  Thank you flipkart.  When I started thinking to depend on you for my shopping activities, you rightly gave me a signal not to trust you!  I appreciate it!  COMPLETELY!                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    You know the specs. I don't think i need to say anything about that. I'll say a bit about the practicality. <br>\n<br>\nLooks : Plainly and comfortably built. Both black and white looks good if that's your cup of tea. But for a person who likes adding some color, it could be a bit dull, especially those pink-loving girlfriends we all have. :D The 4.95 inch full HD screen is gorgeous, and with 445 ppi, its a beautiful way to watch a movie on a flight or a metro ride. Keep in mind that, although good, its not the best out there, Iphone5s and htcOne can still make it look cheap comparitively, but thats also a small difference.<br>\n<br>\nH/W : Camera: For an 8mp its pretty decent a shooter. Though perfect pictures in dim light situations and/or with moving targets are still a distant dream, and comparing with a Lumia1020s 41MP or again the Iphone5s can really really make it look bad. But it does the job well for most of us. And polishing the camera apps and some tuning around could make it better in future android releases. But atm, its just okay.  <br>\n<br>\nPowered with a 2.26 Ghz Snapdragon 800, nexus 5 practically flies. No hitches anywhere unless u were benchmarking. And touch response is also pretty fast though there are a couple of phones that come to mind which can do better, though not significant enough to cause concern or to mention here.  4.4 Kitkat has more polishing to be done, and seeing that google might already be on it, no cause to worry there either. And seeing its a nexus, this one will get to try it the earliest. <br>\nThe graphics performance is also great owing to the adreno330GPU and the 2gigs of RAM. All the best titles on android run without much stutter or dropped frames, though thats not from me, just the word on the street.<br>\n<br>\nOne worrying thing is, battery life is not great. One day is maximum it can manage with moderate use. Seeing with a bigger screen size than the n4 it was to be expected, it is still not a good thing to know. Might need to keep the charger close in most days of constant heavy use. <br>\n<br>\nAltogether, its the best android experience so far seeing its the cleanest stock android4.4 phone that will be available, in addition to the impressive specs and performance. But if you don't care much for the android, and only want the best phone around, this is not it. Its great, unbelievably good for its price, but unbelievably good ONLY for its price, not the best. If it was upto me, id get it no questions asked, but some of us who want a bit more, like the best phone in the market right now, or the phone with the best cam or the best looking phone, this is not it. Its the best optimal package of all that into the most competitive price. Its a 5/5 coz of the price, but keeping the price apart, just phone wise, id give it a 4/5. But that IS pretty good. There are only one, or maybe 2 phones better in the world atm. And they all cost hell of a lot more.                                 </span>"]},

The Gorilla glass and screen is fused together, so the whole component gets replaced, which costs around $150(Rs.6800 in India).

Middle-class ignorants think Samsung is the best. Upper-class ignorants think that Apple is the best. Sure Nexus phones aren't the cheapest or look the most premium, but when it comes to performance, NOTHING even comes close to them. And they have very reasonable price since Google does not intend to earn much profit from them. And they are easily and infinitely customizable. Nexus 5 is definitely the best smartphone in the world right now when you take into account every factor (though Moto X and LG G2 aren't much behind).<br>\nSo forget about your Sammys and Apples.

With thanks to flipkart. Initially I buy Moto X after my friends good review. but my luck was not that good. I got defected piece twice even after replacement.Then I requested to money back and flipkart returned then I go far this lovely mobile.<br>\n<br>\nThere is no doubt in performance of this mobile its very fast.it always shows 1.2 GB free RAM  will all your basic application running. so you can play heavy games. <br>\n<br>\nDesign is good. there is feel good factor when you hold in hand. <br>\n<br>\nAndroid is nice OS.  I recommend buyer if you buy this product. always send feedback to google for your new requirement. of course nexus user will be first user of next new release of android.<br>\n<br>\nCamera : It is good not exceptional but you can enjoy your photos on lappy and mobile. If you want to see your photo on big size TV then you may feel some issue in photo quality.<br>\n<br>\nStill camera has good feature like photo spare is very good.<br>\n<br>\nOk Google : It is very good even better then moto x. You can call message etc using this app.<br>\n<br>\nHeating : Approx No, Mild heat when you play game long time or download heavy data form wifi. Doesn't effect performance. Less heating problem in compression to moto x.<br>\n<br>\nCall Quality: As I have read many issue with microphone while call. I haven't see any issue while call. <br>\n<br>\nBattery: Its depend on your use. At max One day. if you click 70 photos in a day it will run only for 10 hr. Just watch you battery usages. <br>\n<br>\nIf you are using camera/vedio recording you should keep your charger in your bag. <br>\n<br>\nElse it is fine. 24 hr with <br>\n<br>\n2. hr screen <br>\n1 hr call voice<br>\n1/2 hr game play ( basic games)<br>\n14 hr wifi on. <br>\n<br>\nBattery has little less power  but you can handle it. <br>\n<br>\nI gave 5 rating without considering battery of this phone. with battery performance 4.5. it is.                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Unboxed , switch it on , holy crap is that some kind of joke this shit is running faster then my computer DAMN!!!<br>\nsmooth layouts, optimized device, eye catchy as hell<br>\nenough for you to fall in love with it                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    You cannot have a better performing fone at this price.

Faster than my 4GB laptop !<br>\n<br>\nI was sick of Android, but nexus 5 got my faith back!!                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I think its one of the best smart phones at the price at which its available, the processor 2.3 quad core really makes huge difference and with 2GB ram its running like a full fledged machine. The display is amazing with crystal clear images. The best part is that you get immediate updates and if you have a good wifi connection then you will have great fun downloading apps within seconds.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I had sony xperia, then I got Samsung S2 later samsung S3. When lost S3 I got a nokia 520. Fifteen days later I bought Google nexus 5. With this back ground I feel this phone is not the worth money it is being sold for. <br>\ni may not write details, It is slow compared to S2 or S3. Lot of easy features which we routinely use are missing. Steps are little longer. <br>\nIt should have been in a below twenty category. S3 beats easily. <br>\n<br>\nNow yesterday it just slipped from my hand and screen shattered. <br>\nGoogled and found it is a common problem. Right now it is difficult to replace. There is an online petition going on to recall this. So far 256 members have signed. Worldwide so many have found the screen to be very fragile which breaks with minor fall. <br>\n<br>\nCheck there is online petition for recall in . Change.

It is annoying<br>\n - it heats up quite a lot even despite the fact that i do not have any other application beside whatsapp and the ones which came pre-loaded<br>\n<br>\n                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Having problem with both Phone &amp; 3G.  First cannot able to hear the voice properly...  Same goes with the Caller as well.  They are not able to hear my voice properly.<br>\n<br>\nThen comes 3G... couldnt get the connection properly.  While the same is used in another phone, it works.<br>\n<br>\nWhat should i do now.  This new phone has become new pain.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I am a basically Samsung android user, I attracted towards the stock android by seeing the stunning specification of this phone. I bought nexus 5 through Flipkart, good packing good delivery timing. After getting into stock android, I slowly started realizing the bitter truths which are hidden behind the cutting edge hardware specification. Let me list out the points directly by not discussing its specification, because you can get tons of sites which are displaying specification. I wonder, I did lot of research before buying this phone, but I never came across the following points during my research, this is the review of the phone after the usage of nearly one month.<br>\n <br>\n1) Since it does not have in-built file manager, you need to download one file manager after immediately switching on the phone in order to access the memory for the files like .pdf .xls .doc .apk etc. There are no such user friendly file manager in play store, you need to compromise with one, I did the same with OI file manager<br>\n<br>\n2) It has blue tooth connectivity, but you cant send any file through blue tooth. To do this you need to install third party app, This might be because of lack of inbuilt file manger,  remember the receiver should also have same app in order to receive the file. But you can easily receive the files without any problem<br>\n<br>\n3) It has wifi direct facility, but you cant use it. To use this you need to install third party app and (same blue tooth problem) receiver should also have same app.<br>\n<br>\n4) Every one complains about battery life, I got decent one day battery life after a moderate usage (Internet connection is 2G, not hardcore game lover)<br>\n<br>\n5) The main part is Mobile network connectivity problem, automatically network goes off and never returns back. To regain the network connectivity every time you need to search the network in settings menu, I did all circus, I gone through all settings to over come this problem, but problem still remains same. Many users have this problem after up-gradation to Kitkat,  I wonder why Google guys are neglecting this problem since the launch of kitkat. I used to miss lot of company calls and personal calls if I fail to check the network connectivity in phone regularly. Day by day it is getting worse, and I am planning to return the phone since it has one month returnable warranty.<br>\n<br>\n6) Many users also reported wifi connectivity problem, I have not faced such problems so far.<br>\n<br>\n7) Camera does its work better in daylight but lags in night time<br>\n<br>\n8) It has multi color notification LED, through which you can easily recognize the phone message, watsapp message,missed calls and so on with out swiping up the display. But some times it malfunctions by blinking without any notification <br>\n<br>\n9) All hardwares are of cutting edge technology and having stunning specification, the good part is that phone never hangs, this is because of high frequency CPU, 2 GB RAM, Absence of Blotware, Light weight of stock android. At the same time stock android sucks in many aspects. <br>\n<br>\nFinally a good hardwared phone with lot of software bugs, think twice before going to this. It seems Google is not going to address all this bugs in near future. Beware of your hard earned money.<br>\nI am returning the phone                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Yes this phones doesn't come with ear phones. I guess its not costlier on Flipkart because the price given on play store is EXCLUDING TAX. In the US the phone cost 399$, thats the price on play store. But at payment it shows around 440$. So I don't think flipkart has over priced it, though I feel google has over priced it ;)<br>\nAtleast with that pricetag I would have liked a set of earphones as well. But having said that, the specifications are wonderful.                                  </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I purchased this phone just because of pure Android and of course mighty hardware.<br>\n<br>\nIndeed this phone is a monster specwise but the culprit for me is that crap, called pure Android,  sucked the life out of me. Full-fledged piece of sh*t, bugs in everything made the pure Android experience a living hell.<br>\n<br>\nWell done LG, but screw you google, AOSP, OHA or any dumb individual involved in development of Android 4.4.2.<br>\n<br>\nP.S.<br>\nIf you consider to buy this phone and change the rom or wait for update then here is a news that there is absolutely no stable rom for this phone(no CWM, MIUI) and next android is no way near.<br>\n<br>\nThink before you purchase this in essence of pure android.Samsung , Sony, HTC are not fools for not providing pure android.                                </span>"]}]
