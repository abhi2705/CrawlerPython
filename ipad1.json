I had planned of many things of doing with an iPad mini. But I never expected to keep it with the service center for more than a month !!<br>\n<br>\nThe display had an issue since the very beginning. It was extremely yellowish in color. This problem was starkly evident on white background. This really ruined the apple experience for me.<br>\n<br>\nWhat is more heartening is that my friends who also got iPad mini at the same time, didn't had any problem like this. When I talked to apple customer care they gave me funny reasons like for India apple is providing yellow display. <br>\n<br>\nWhen I told them I checked with friends and other store I didn't find any yellow display they first decline to acknowledge that it is a problem. But when I send photos as a proof that the displays in other stores are fine, they said that its in the specification of apple to have both yellowish and normal display and I have to accept the display as is.<br>\n<br>\nI told them if this is the case then confirm it in mail that its apple specifications to have yellow display they declined to do so.<br>\n<br>\nNOW I ADVICE YOU TO NEVER BUY AN APPLE PRODUCT ONLINE AS ITS A PURE GAMBLE WHAT YOU WOULD GET. <br>\n<br>\nONCE YOU HAVE IT THEY ARE NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING IT IS A PROBLEM. WHILE YOUR FRIENDS ENJOY APPLE EXPERIENCE, YOU WOULD BE STUCK UP WITH A YELLOW DISPLAY THAT WOULD RUIN AN APPLE EXPERIENCE FOR YOU<br>\n<br>\nI hope Flikpkart would take notice and help me out in this case as I have given up hopes on apple customer care                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    The title is a little confusing but this is I want to say that if you are going for samsung then you are certainly going to miss the ultimate apple experience.<br>\n<br>\nUnlike it's competitors when apple launches something for a cheaper price, it still makes sure that the quality is not compromised.<br>\n<br>\nI hope you will benefit from this tab as much as I did. <br>\n<br>\nPros:<br>\nDisplay<br>\nSpeed<br>\nWi Fi connectivity<br>\nBattery life<br>\nPretty Handy<br>\n<br>\nCons:<br>\nNone till now for me                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Hello all, let me share with you people my experience using an ipad mini with some ratings. I had a Spice stellar before and have also tried Ipad 2,3 and 4. all below mentioned ratings are for the ipad mini with 10 being the maximum:<br>\n<br>\nDisplay 8.5 : having used a spice stellar pad before, the display is very good, may not be as good as ipad 4 though.<br>\n<br>\nDesign  9 : It makes the ipad 4 look massive and outdated in the design department, seriously, why the original ipad design in the latest ipad? The build quality and looks are simply amazing! always go for a black, because white borders are too distracting, on the other hand, black borders seems to blend with the display. <br>\n<br>\nGaming 8 : the gaming experience is very good, the graphics is superb, it can easily handle nova 3, but, you might feel the need for a little more real estate. But, no way it is congested, very comfortable to hold for long hours.<br>\n<br>\nOS 7.5 : iOS 6 is one of the most criticised mobile OS and I agree with it. ..having used android 4.2 I can clearly notice the lack of options to customise. Ex: no widgets, no custom keyboard, no file manager, the iOS 6 is not really bad, the experience is still very good, the 5 finger pinch app exit feature is superb! The user interface is silk smooth, and you can feel the richness of the jitter free interface.<br>\n<br>\nBrowsing 6 : this is a bit of a disappointment, the biggest culprit here is flash, it simply ruins your browsing experience. It is also very hard to read in the portrait mode, as you have to double tap every time you open a web page. What is the point in going for a large display when you have to double tap every time?<br>\n<br>\nMovie experience 4 : simply too small to watch movies, the display quality may be good, you can almost forget watching movies on this.<br>\n<br>\nBattery 9 : continuous gaming the battery lasts for upto 6.5 hours. a bit of gaming and browsing continuously it lasts for upto 8 hrs! <br>\n<br>\nMultitasking 10 : I run several apps together and it does not lag one bit. I can safely say that iOS 512MB RAM = Android 1GB RAM all apple softwares are so well written unlike android and windows, there are practically no bloatwares.<br>\n<br>\nI would try to answer some of the questions springing in the minds of a prospective customer:<br>\n<br>\nWifi or cellular? <br>\nWifi! I wirelessly tether from my android phone and the speed is very good! I have gps in my android phone, so I do not need it either.<br>\n<br>\nBlack or white?<br>\nBlack! as mentioned before, white borders are too distracting, it makes your display look smaller, but the back silver panel on the white is incredibly sexy!<br>\n<br>\nIpad mini or ipad 2/3/4?<br>\nIpad mini! The ipad 2/3 and 4 are too big, the weird 4:3 aspect ratio, very difficult to carry around. Those thick bazels! the original ipad design even now in the ipad 4 th generation? What is apple thinking? Ipad 2 display is very bad, ipad 3 hardware not good enough to handle retina display, that is why ipad for was quickly released within a span of 6 months.<br>\n<br>\n16GB or 32GB?<br>\n16GB is good enough for apps and games. I do not store music and videos in my ipad mini.<br>\n<br>\nI still give the ipad mini a 4 star rating for the sheer pleasure of possesing an apple product, the promising iOS7 update in the future, some complete and solid  fix for flash in the near future. ..come on what are your options? Samsung is selling overpriced garbage, Nexus 7 display is too small and 10 is overpriced. The reliabilty of Indian and chinese tablets are questionable, I returned my spice stellar within 1 month of purchase. Amazon kindle 8 inch and 9 inch are yet to be released in India, at the momment I think ipad mini is the best your money can buy:) use it now and resell later in future if you find a better product, apple products have a good resale value:)<br>\n<br>\n                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Hey friends, here i want to share somethings about apple product. apple product is known for it's brilliant build quality and simplicity. i have faith in apple products that's why i ordered not 1 but 3 ipad minis for me and my family. many people talking about ipad that it has only 512MB of RAM and 1GHZ dual core processor but the thing is they don't know that apple uses different Operating system called iOS which don't need quadcore or octacore processor for faster, smooth performance and apple maid more than 3 lakh apps designed only for ipad. these apps are specially made for ipad screen resolution and u will not notice any type of lag while using it otherwise apps will only stretched like we seen in all other android tablet.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I was initially impressed with flipkart on seeing this offer, i became curious and planned to buy..But looks like this model is available on other sites at approx. same price...then why do i have to give my old smartphone, laptop or tab in exchange...Flipkart seems no long pocket friendly...                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Pros:<br>\n<br>\n. Awesome performance. Like a silk touch. I have 2 other tablets but nothing matches iOS.<br>\n. Great looking, sturdy and sleek built. <br>\n. Quality of iApps. <br>\n. Amazing flipcart delivery. Delivered in 2 days.<br>\n. Even though resolution is less, color saturation is very good. <br>\n. Gives same fluidity and performance after 1 year. Most androids becomes very slow and buggy over the period even with 1 gig RAM and processors. <br>\n<br>\nUltimately, you ll have own an iPad in order to 'feel' it.<br>\n<br>\nCons:<br>\n<br>\n. Average audio/video quality. Doesn't support all formats. <br>\n. Battery life with WiFi on. But even all other tabs suffers from this.<br>\n. iTunes. Sucky software. You can't use it a storage device.<br>\n. No Email saving. Pricey office suite application.<br>\n. Price. Should be around 17K. That's what it cost in US<br>\n<br>\nAll in all, I spend more time in apps and using outlook and surfing for which, it's great. I don't  listen songs and clicking pictures so I am okay with average feature. <br>\n<br>\n                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I bought Ipad mini yesterday after lot of deliberation. I was really disappointed by the price of Nexus 7 in India, it is double of what they are selling in US. While Ipad mini is Rs. 3.5k to 4k more in Indian market. <br>\n<br>\nSpecs wise even though Nexus 7 is better on paper, the screen quality, display and user experience of Ipad Mini is unbeatable. I was looking for a tablet with good display especially for reading books, surfing net. Ipad Mini fits the bill. <br>\n<br>\nIf you are more into playing games I would recommend Nexus 7. It has got 1 GB RAM, quad core Tegra processor which is ideal for games. And if you are some one who wants every possible feature into a single tablet and not very particular with quality go for Samsung Tab 2.<br>\n<br>\nCons of Ipad Mini:<br>\n<br>\n. The only serious one I have seen in Ipad Mini is lack of retina display, you will observe this more in images with lot of details. The zoom quality is not that good, the pixels are coarse &amp; grainy, it is good otherwise and much better than other tablets.<br>\n<br>\n. Got only wi-fi, you need to pay 8k more for cellular. For people who wanna use while travelling I would suggest buy only wifi Ipad model &amp; purchase a cheap portable battery operated modem, which supports 2g,3g,4g, all in one.<br>\n<br>\n. A 16GB Ipad mini gives only 13 GB space for usage and it is not extendable. This is a serious problem for people who store lot of songs &amp; videos. A 32 GB version costs 6k more. But you can always take the backup in PC or on iCloud. Even Nexus 7 is not extendable but you can use USB on the go cable to connect extenal Hard discs which is not possible for Ipad mini.<br>\n<br>\nIt is out of stock in FlipKart for many days other wise I would have bought it here. Even in Imagine store it was out of stock which clearly shows its high demand.                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    After waiting for more than a month,apple releases the much awaited apple ipad mini<br>\nspecifications<br>\n<br>\npros<br>\n1)handy size-7.9 inches<br>\n2)5Mp isight camera-visually stunning<br>\n3)1.2 Mp front camera<br>\n3)extremely light weight<br>\n4)full aluminium body<br>\n5) 1GHz dual core processor,this works like a charm<br>\n6)light on your pocket for the features<br>\n<br>\ncons<br>\n1) resolution-not expected from apple<br>\n<br>\nthats it...but the resolution is not such a downer<br>\nand please,now that the mini is out,DONT THINK ABOUT SAMSUNG OR GOOGLE,<br>\n<br>\nthe tablet doesnt exactly come in one hand..but its still a handy size..the resolution is more than enough...all games run smoothly as expected and the camer is awesome..build quality is mind blowing...<br>\nenjoy<br>\ncheers<br>\nkeshav                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Apple iPad mini is a huge disappointment. It's an inferior product with many compatibility issues. I switched from an android tab to apple one hoping for better performance but I was in for a shock for so many reasons.<br>\n<br>\n1, iPad doesnt support immensely popular app like whatsapp<br>\n2. Half the times when you are trying to download apps you get an error \"This app cannot be downloaded at this time\" and if you google for this error, you will get many people who are facing this issue.<br>\n3. This iPad hangs whenever I use Gmail<br>\n4. iPad doesnt support immensely popular app like instagram<br>\n5. I am a freelancer and use apps from freelance websites regularly like eLance and oDesk. Surprisingly neither eLance nor oDesk is available for iPad.<br>\n6. There is no way to hide personal apps on iPad which can be done so smoothly on an android tab.<br>\n7. They do not provide a hands-free (ear phone) with iPad mini<br>\n8. Every time you install an app you have to enter your apple password. This is extremely annoying.<br>\n9. I started facing issues with this tab right from second day of purchase. The seller WS Retail disaaprove my request for replacement. I would not recommend iPad as well as W S Reatil to anybody. (I had been buying from W S retial for so long and I am a flipkart first member, still I have to face this issue. Terribly disappointed)                                </span>"]},

After using the tablet for a lil over 3 months now, I am so glad I opted to try out an Apple device. <br>\n<br>\nApple stands a class apart in terms of both the product quality and the apps that are built for it. Rarely experienced any hiccups while using the tablet. I did feel a lil awkward with the fact that you cant access the storage for transferring any files and the fact that the files are closely tied with the apps that you use for you to upload them onto the device. <br>\n<br>\nBut that said, the device doesn't feel cheap or compromised and one can surely give this a try if they're new to Apple and are in a dilemma whether to go for this one over an Android tablet. One would surely love the quality of Apple.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    It never lags, has tons of applications and customization. I just might buy an iPhone soon thanks to this tablet.

I have been a android lover for the past many years. I hated apple because of its limitations. In December I bought the google nexus from Flipkart and enjoyed the experience just for two months after which it started hanging and just wudnt  boot up. I lost all my trust on android. <br>\nThe iPad is in a league of its own. Forget ram or ghz it doesn't matter wth this beauty. Everything is super smooth and made for the iPad unlike android tablets where the apps r common with mobile phones. The entire experience of using this tab is mind blowing. And now even more value because of some apps r available free like keynote, numbers, iPhoto garage band. This is a tab that u can use for work or play. Yes it's expensive but use the exchange offer to its fullest. That's what I have done ! If you have the money for the retina go for it otherwise the mini is just fine as it is. This will definitely change the way you do things and wil make stuff all the easier and fun. The apps are actually made for the iPad mini. It's got a mix for everyone. Hope you enjoy the iPad just like how I'm enjoying every bit of it. Thx Flipkart for making this exchange possible and getting this product to me on time.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Hi frds,<br>\n<br>\n i bought ipad2 an year ago after they slashed 100$ when next model was launch. to accept indian using only upto 60% of the any product they buy.<br>\n<br>\nprice wise apple is more than other tab. i was satisfied with ipad 2 features expect camera quality , and after using long days i felt some thing smaller would be better , i was waiting for this ipad mini from the rumors started.<br>\n<br>\nThis product as grt features and touch and stability.<br>\n<br>\nipad uses:<br>\n1) Have collection of photos of fav ones.<br>\n2)  Browsing, read news through apps.<br>\n3) check mail often or FB and chat , skype and video chat is best.<br>\n4) some time music and videos - for HD <br>\n5) keep some fav movie <br>\n6) small games for family kids rarely.<br>\n<br>\nThere is one option i dont knw whether apple users found , in setting - &gt; some text speech option is there , On that first , than while browsing some article u select para than it will show copy,paste,speech . if u click speech it will read the article like news reader , in setting choose lang and speed levels.<br>\n<br>\nif people dont connect with internet expect inside home ,they can go for wifi models.<br>\nfor this purpose people can go for ipad.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    i buy this tablet and i saw that it does not support some apps but those are running my brothers samsung tab 2.it  has started hanging in few days and the its wifi gets damaged. i complaint to apple service centre but they said that we konw that your tab has gets damaged under inyhe warranty but we have not responsible for inner harm of apple i pad mini because it was the cheapest tab yet developed by apple. but samsung tab 2 is more better than ipad mini.it also has call facility. please dont buy this tab                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    why to by other tab when at this price we get apple ipad Mini.<br>\nUsing it from 1 month and no problems received till now. i use it 5-6 hrs a day. install apps..

There is no doubt it is a great product, especially if one has not had the android experience. It is great for reading pdf files, browsing the web, and so on. Battery life is amazing, especially on standby. There is no microsd expansion slot. If you are used to a file system. as in Windows desktop PCs and in Android Phones, you won't find one here. And a file goes in either through a trusted computer or through the net, and is basically transferred to the care of a specific application.  Bluetooth is rudimentary, and is meant only to connect headphones and stuff, and the concept of wifi-direct is non existent. There is no smooth way to transfer files from your android smartphone to the ipad, except by using cloud based software. If you must, buy it for its sheer beauty, and snob value. But if the ability to tweak and modify, and flexibility are desired, go for a high end android tablet.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Ipad mini is simply amazing and if you are planning to buy a tablet, better go for it. <br>\nI have been using ipod touch 4th for quite sometime and now i got the ipad mini thru flipkart.<br>\nUsually developers say, android tablets may be customized and apple ecosystem does not allow you to do, but the android customization will be done only after rooting the phone to get access to the kernel....(which voids the warranty)...So no regrets to buy ipad mini.....<br>\nAssuming if you have only 10% of battery left in your phone or tablet, how long it will take to charge again? hardly 20 minutes. But Ipad Mini works for more than 2 hours to charge again.. its still runs today (almost 7 months later). Really a good device.<br>\n<br>\nPros:<br>\n1. Better Battery, lasting for 10 hours<br>\n2. Good resolution<br>\n3. With 512MB RAM, its rocking like anything (i have opened almost 40 applications and still the game Subway Surfer works without any lag)<br>\n4. There are huge number of apps in the Apple store dedicated for ipad (also you can download the apps that were developed for iphone too).<br>\n5. good response time in the touch.<br>\n6. internet is fast as it uses 802.11b/g/n....<br>\n7. ios7 ecosystem, extremely superb.....<br>\n<br>\nCons:<br>\n1. Retina screen is absent (But that doesn't make any difference)<br>\n2. No ear pods<br>\nSo if you are thinking to procure a tablet with a budget of 20k, better try ipad mini. <br>\n<br>\nFlipkart delivered the ipad mini in just one day (chennai)                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Bought 16 GB ipad mini .

Proud owner of an apple .<br>\n<br>\nFlipkart has delivered the same within 24 hours of order.

Screen: Larger screen and better aspect ratio(4:3 vs 16:9 on the Nuxus 7) allows for better internet surfing, better games, more comfortable keypad to type on.<br>\n<br>\n2. Apps: The iPad has over 250,000 specially made for the iPad and all of the iPhone apps work as well. Nexus 7 has just 100 or so apps and others look ugly on it's 7\" screen(because they are just stretched out phone apps).<br>\n<br>\n3. Ease of use: It's much more simple to use and has many productivity applications that can allow you to do some serious work as opposed to the Nexus 7 which is just a 'showy' device because of it's lack of apps.<br>\n<br>\n4. The cameras are much better, it's ergonomics and slim profile make it easier to use and hold in one hand(keep in mind this is almost 8 inches) which truly allows you to use the device to it's full potential.<br>\n<br>\n5. Longer battery life and more security for your credit card payments and every single app is better on the iPad than on Android(see the Gmail app on both tablets if you don't believe me)<br>\n<br>\n6. Better audio quality and metal construction vs plastic on the Nexus and not at all slow even while playing games like Vice City.<br>\n<br>\nCONS:<br>\n    The screen ratio will make movies shrink a bit and you have to convert every movie into .mp4 format but that's it.<br>\n<br>\nBottom line:<br>\n<br>\nBuy the Nexus if you like to tweak around with your device and like to be geeky all the time. For everyone else, the iPad is the tablet of choice. It's a brilliant experience that only Apple can offer.<br>\n<br>\nTIP: if you can, wait till the end of the year and buy the iPad mini 2 which will include a retina display as well.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I bought iPad by exchanging my Nexus tab.

None forcing you to sign in/up for specific account. No hangs leading to brutally crack back cover and popping battery. No stretched apps from phone all apps are built again for iPad taking advantage of big screen. Direct device replacement on finding an acceptable defect in product. The built quality is superior and metallic. Even a \u20b95000 apple book case is worth to protect this precious product.

I'm pretty focused on the performance after updating my iPad to iOS7. Well many complained of slowing down, but mine didn't. Some minor hiccups though, but unnoticeable. And I shouldn't complain about this as I love my iPad for playing games and I leave my apps opened in background throughout the day and close them all before I reach my bed at night. That means, those high end games and my other office apps are kept minimised throughout the day keeping the background app refresh active! If this was a case in a Nexus 7, the tegra 3 quad core wouldn't allow you to keep these many high end apps in the background as when I was testing nexus 7 by playing Real Racing 3, I found a reduced details than the iPad, and I found that the CPU usage was much high, whereas even after updating to iOS 7, Real Racing, nor Infinity blade or Asphalt 8 has reduced a bit a quality!! The battery life of iPad amazed me since the day I'm the owner of it. Apple promises of 10 hours of battery life, and it keeps its promise with heavy game play and provides more than a day backup on medium use with garageband and traktor dj with medium game play! Just awesome!!! Also it is the best to read eBooks and the iBook interface? Every one will be getting envy on you on seeing the interface.. <br>\nI was low on budget and I just wanted to have an Apple device and so I bought a 16GB, wifi version iPad mini, but you know what? I fell in love with it. So light. So sleek, so beautiful, the classic built and the fine cut edges makes its look much more appealing and premium and I think the engineering on an Apple device makes it more pricy than others.<br>\nYou can view all types of document file formats from .pdf to all other Microsoft Office formats. For better viewing download the app Document by readdle and you are open to all. Well there is no free document editor for Android also, you have to buy. In android, piracy is allowed which is strictly prohibited in Apple, so be legal by buying apps. There are paid apps like polaris office, or Quick office for your iOS to edit Microsoft office documents. These are also priced the same in Android. One of the best thing in Apple is that, you have to keep your eyes open to get your favourite premium apps for free as apple features them in App of the Day or App of the week. And you'll never get them free in android!! And you need not buy apps cz each and every app in the app store has anreal quality unlike in the Google Play store. About the mail attachments, you can mail multiple attachments at a time using the app Documents by Readdle. But you cannot email music as again apple takes care of the privacy. You cannot send music. You cannot download music from other websites using the browsers. The browser will play the music but won't allow you to download, you can again use Document by readdle to download music. And iTunes have each and every music from local language music to hindi... It has a vast library!!!!<br>\nOne of the best feature of Apple devices is that you'll get several updates and not just one or two or maximum 5 like in Android devices.<br>\nI had more to say but I need to sum up. I sum up by saying that I have spent my \u20b921900 for buying a gadget, and this gadget is returning me back each and every penny by its service!!! Still no problems yet!!!<br>\nI love my iPad mini..l                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I got these from flipkart  on 31st August.it is a fantastic device for gaming, video calling and for all the things that are necessary for a tablet. It doesn't have retina display but still the display is very good.runs all heavy graphics superbly without any lag. And Apple gives software updates frequentl.<br>\nRear camera takes some decent photographs in light and front camera is superb. Don't feel that ram is too low (512mb) it runs everything fine without a single lag issue.so worth buying it.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    If you are planning to buy.

The device neves lags or hangs .its perfectly smooth as butter.<br>\n<br>\nThe touch is outstanding compared to the galaxy. I am a gaming freak.<br>\nAnd for all gaming freaks this is the best buy.<br>\n<br>\nIf you go for phones .it offers you just a 5inch screen which is absolutely not bad, but nothing like having the experience of an 8inch screen.<br>\n<br>\nThe iPad 2,3.4 is too big and is very hard to handle. The iPad mini's size is perfect.<br>\n<br>\nBut the camera is disappointing. I know it only offers a 5mp camera but the images when zoomed in and shot is very shabby and is very disappointing. There is also no flash available with the camera.<br>\n <br>\nSome people thing that the apple devices is very restricted. Reviews from apple haters are <br>\nMy god I feel suffocated and all those crazy stuff.<br>\n<br>\nI know it's prey irritating to download songs from your computer, put it inside iTunes and transfer it to your apple device but it isn't a herculent job either.<br>\n<br>\nAndroid flagships are nothing compared to the mighty apple devices.<br>\nI ensure you guys the iOS is very simple and user friendly.<br>\nThe android phones like s4, s3 are very heavily loaded with features  and these phones lags.<br>\n<br>\nThough these phones may offer you a quad core processor but it simply sucks.<br>\n<br>\nThe iPad mini also runs on the latest iOS 6.1.3 which is trily awesome.<br>\nIt looks attractive and rich.<br>\n<br>\nGuys but be careful the device is too delicate and may break if it falls down .<br>\nEnsure its in the flip over<br>\n<br>\nI hope this review will help you make a good choice                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I have used so many electronic products...but I must say this was the best what money can buy.....Ebboks, newspapers, Social networking, Video calling, Email and especially games  and lot many mind blowing apps....and i have used other tablets such as samsung, nexus...but ipad is way beyond all those....and best thing battery lasts for close to 7 hrs when ur using wifi...and best part it doesn't get heated up unlike other devices...<br>\nIf you are a first time user of apple devices...you make take some time to get along with itunes,syncing and others... you may feel few thing are restricted....but once start using it..you will never look back.<br>\nGo for It!!!!!                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Everyone out there is comparing the Ipad mini with other tablets in the market especially Nexus 7.Let me tell you one thing first :<br>\nDo you want to run the Benchmarks in your tab and say hey my tab has 1500 geek score or do you want to feel the performance of your tab.<br>\nIf you observe the gaming in both these tabs (NFS MW) you will never look at nexus 7 again in your life.even though it has 1500 geek when compared to 750 of mini...when it comes to performance the scenario is completely reversed..<br>\nIn case anyone interested in comparing geekscores, better compare the ANDROID tabs, phones (SAMSUNG,SONY,HTC,LG) but never ever involve APPLE in this aspect because Geek score is the representation of Hardware mostly but where is the perfect sync between SW &amp; HW. All these companies are assembling diff processors,GPUs and saying dual core quad core oct core n Hex core,but remember guys whatever may be the core in those phones or tabs APPLE can handle them with its dual core 1Ghz Processor thats for sure.<br>\nMost important of all is the hardware degradation:<br>\nUse nexus 7 for 3-6 months and again run your fav app it will give you no more than 1000 and after 1year 500 after that tab wont be able to run that app either..that wont happen in case of Apple products Use it for 2,3,4 years the same performance,same graphics,same score..Those who cant afford 22k better wait till you can afford 22k, but dont go for cheap tablets,In case you definitely want tablet and cant afford 22k then go for nexus 7.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    First of all hats off to flipkart for the express delivery...less than 48 hrs that's just awesome.<br>\n<br>\nAbout the product its great device.best thing about it the battery life more than 10 hrs whatever you do that's superb.screen is decent .software experience is smooth that's what u expect of iOS .app collection is also good .<br>\n<br>\nAbout the cons <br>\n<br>\nHad hard time to get a decent flash browser.<br>\nAlso memory ....as u can't connect external memory without jailbreak it's hard to contain with 16gb .but I checked the net for some getaway and come to know that their are few wireless card reader which can read even external HDD .<br>\nI would like to request flipkart to ship this kinda things as well.<br>\n<br>\n                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Yes, i agree apple is apple. But Google is nothing less at this stage. Nexus 7 can be double its price in india, but its totally worth it. ipad mini and nexus 7 both are great, the difference being ios and android. Decide which os you will be more comfortable with and then buy. If you are a casual user go for ios. But if you want to explore your device, customize it according to your wish, don't think twice, go for android. Android is the fully customizable os while ios is a simpler one with less options for exploring. And particularly for this device what i feel is that nexus 7 is a little ahead for some reasons. But the final choice is between android and ios (i went for android for its wider interface, where you can do a lot without rooting). Choose wisely....                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Even though Nexus 7 might have better specifications than the iPad Mini, iPad mini will be the better experience for almost anything you do in real life.<br>\n<br>\nThis is because apple's iOS is much, much stable and proven than the android OS. in iOS, there is a perfect play between the Hardware and the software to bring out the best of what is in it. Android products need to have much higher specifications to get the same quality because Android is still a kid compared to Apple's iOS. <br>\n<br>\nBottomline : Buy Apple iPad Mini if you want the best eventhough it is little costlier<br>\n<br>\nBuy Nexus 7 if you want to customize you themes, download applications for free, etc, etc<br>\n<br>\nI would buy the iPad mini anyday of the year                                </span>"]}]
