Flipkart is partnering in it. The reason for my inference is based on following experience.<br>\n<br>\nI got Moto E delivered to me on 6th June 2014. I started getting problems in charging as well as restarting it after its battery got fully drained within first 15 days. It happened a couple of times. Somehow, I could manage to start it and then charge it by trying various things like, starting while charger is plugged in or starting after charger is disconnected, etc. No general behaviour was found that when and how I can start it and when not! It looked like all random. Now, the problem started aggravating. I kept it for charging for the whole night, found it fully charged up and removed in the morning, say at 8:00 am, and left on the desk idle. At 8:30 am, when I picked it up for making a call, I found that it is off and not turning up by power switch!!! So I plugged in charger (again a random try) and then tried to switch it on. It started but showed the battery to be 1%!!! So (again randomly) I tried a restart. After restart it showed the battery to be 89%!!! So I took it off the charger, made a call or two and left on the desk idle. Again after 30 mins or so, when I picked it up, it was found in off state!!! Repeated the exercise!!! After 3 to 4 such cycles in a time period of 2 days, now the problem has alleviated to yet another level!!! It is just not switching ON!!! No matter how and what you do!!! Charger plugged, plugged for 8 hours, unplugged, whatsoever!!!<br>\n<br>\nBy the time I reached this state, it was about 31st or 32nd day of the delivery, and hence Flipkart denied me of replacement or return of the device!!! Contacted Motorola service centre, They suggested me some battery calibration steps after 3 to 4 phone calls over two days!! Interestingly, the first step in their calibration suggestion says, \"Switch on your device\"!!! Now that is what is not happening!!! So again called them. Ask me to go to Service centre, which is about 50 km from my place in the adjacent city! I requested them to show me some steps over phone to do something. The reply was that, since it was not starting at all, there is some hardware problem. I told that it is more severe then that your device gives such hardware problem within one month. So you should replace it. They said only flipkart or service centre can decide on that!!!<br>\n<br>\nThen I surveyed net for similar problems in Motorola phones and learned that this type of problem is not new to Moto E or to Motorola, it is widely reported on ned even for Moto G. So Motorola knew about this problem and still launched the selling of Moto E without bothering to solve it first. So I think that they don't care of the quality of the product to be sold in India!!!<br>\n<br>\nPeople should simply boycott their products....                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Been over a week since this phone arrived and i will hold on by the previous review i wrote - mentioned below. In the meantime have used the phones extensively and found that all is not \"sunny under the sunshine\" . Some CONS are:<br>\n1) MAJOR ONE - the back covr has become loose. As in evrytime you hold it in your palm you can feel that its sliding a little bit from its position. feels a lot awkward.<br>\n2) BATTERY life - however smooth they make android , its still going to be a power hog..... battery still drains a lost faster compared to lets say a WP handset.<br>\n3) Prone to FingerPrints - be it the back plastic or the glass screen the whole phoen is prone to smudges and figerprints which is kinda undesirable.<br>\n4) the speakers are in the front which can be a good thing or bad , and dont ask me why, but i don't like it much personally.<br>\n5)camera is sub par .<br>\n6) the backpanels launched for a 7k phone are way to expensive at nearly 500 bucks /cover<br>\n<br>\nBUT i will still hold on to the fact that at 7k this phone is very good considering its screens brightness and touch response being much much superior to many other entry level phones in the market. <br>\nSTill lavel itas a BUY for anyone who wants a entry level phone.<br>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nFor the price this phone has been launched is just plain ridiculous !! I remember the phones with such specs costing 15-18k couple of  years back (remember Sony Xperia P) . Anyhow just unboxed it last night and here is my take on it :<br>\n1) Screen is awesome for 7k and cant believe its Gorilla Glass 3<br>\n2) The weight is slightly high (more so than Lumia 520 -just slightly)<br>\n3) The design ergonomics is good enough . Doesn't feel plasticky or cheap. MoTO did a great job in designing this CHEAP handset<br>\n4) Network reception was good ,point being that In my area all telecom companies network strength is poor . So this showing up nearly all the bars at ts signal strength was good.<br>\n5) The Speakers are LOUD . Which is a plus for Indians somehow. ;) <br>\n6) Internal Memory is less but then have added a 16GB SanDisk card and its handling it nicely. <br>\n7) Mostly vanilla  Android which is a plus ( until unless its sense 6 :D ) no unnecessary customisations. <br>\n8) It makes an ideal gift - which it was,  for my sis :).<br>\n<br>\nHaven't found any cons yet but can already point out some , having used Android before , the major issue will be Memory utilization and battery performance . So lets wait and see how it turns out to be after a few days performance.                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    To all those who are saying it is released today how can one post review...<br>\n<br>\nI had ordered this today ie. on 14'May at 12:10 AM and got it delivered by 01:00 PM using same day delivery option. Flipkart as usual delivers within no time and really worth it paying Rs.140 for same day delivery.<br>\n<br>\nComing to Moto E, I am sure no other branded mobiles are available at this price range and with this specs. All the sepcs related to RAM, processor, Gorilla glass and mostly screen resolution are good. I  recommend this personally comparing the price and spec. I feel it had most but only flash light is missing which if present would have nothing to be improved.  It is really good and happy to share this.                                 </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    I ordered MOTO E on Flipkart on the launch day as a gift for my wife &amp; got it delivered it on May 20, 2014 and within few days the internal display screen broke while it  accidentally fell from just few inches on the desk ..is it that fragile ???<br>\n<br>\nBelieve me this is a serious issue. Its toooooo fragile &amp; the worst part is ..Motorola's Service , they don't have display spare units in their stock &amp; would ask you to wait few months to get the broken display replaced for Rs 5000/- .. <br>\nRidiculous...can\u2019t believe they are charging 5000/- Rs to replace low quality so called Gorilla display for a phone that costs 7K ..is this a another way to earn some easy bucks by fooling customers ??<br>\n<br>\nThe overall phone is good but ..I\u2019m really had a bad experience with its display issue. Even if you get it repaired, how long that will last??<br>\n<br>\nI recently got to know that, Motorola is replacing broken screen for free for their phone users across globe but not for Indian buyers from Flipkart. This in itself explains how low quality screen they have embedded in their phones to suffer end users.<br>\nFlipkart should look into this &amp; get this issues fixed with Motorolo  ..But I feel they are more interested in their Sales count than what customers feel it once it\u2019s been sold.<br>\nThis problem is faced by many moto users\u2026..not only Moto E but also for Moto G ... please search it on Google/ Motorola forums to see the numbers of complaints/issues raised for this low quality display issue .. and the Motorola support has no satisfying answer to this issue.<br>\n<br>\nI would advise buyers\u2026.think TEN times before going for Moto E &amp; Moto G.<br>\n<br>\n                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Collectively, my family owns cellphones from the following brands: HTC; Samsung; LG (my old phone); Nokia<br>\nWhile my LG and dad's Samsung comes in the price range of 12k-15k<br>\nMy sister's HTC One X plus was bought for 28,000.<br>\n<br>\nSoon after buying LG I regretted, the touch interface; graphic display; processor speed is  not upto the mark. Bought two years back and having spent 12k on it, I was carrying on with it  but was on a constant lookout for a better phone. Ever since Moto G hit the market, I was almost convinced to buy it, and then on Wednesday, 14 May I saw the full paper ad in TOI which read: Rs.6999 Moto E!<br>\nI logged in instantly and ordered this phone, even though there was very little user knowledge on it (since it was launched that very day!)<br>\n<br>\nThis phone was delivered to me yesterday (in flat 2 days, way before the stipulated time) And yes it feels good that its out of stock :D<br>\nComing back to the main point (reviewing the product, guess the avid blogger spirit and me cant refrain itself from setting up a good background to a story...)<br>\n<br>\nA) The phone is way beyond what you see in the videos and promos online, it blows you away with the graphic display, excellent touch interface and is way better than any Samsung or LG phone <br>\n<br>\nB) You will have to pinch yourself to believe, it cost you just Rs.7000!<br>\n<br>\nC) For those who like to click away from your phone, Caution: This phone does not have a front camera or a back flashlight and does not auto focus. But for others like me, who hardly bother and the love of photography is practiced by using 'cameras', this will hardly make any difference in your MotoE experience! <br>\n<br>\nD) The body of the phone is sturdy (not cheap looking at all!) I bought a white one and am looking forward to booking a nice MotoE cover when it will be launched next week.<br>\n<br>\nE) It has all the features of any Android phone. Caution: The processor is dual core processor and just to bust the myth: this does not slow down the phone system in any way <br>\n<br>\nF) I am not a hard core heavy gamer (certainly not on my phone!) so I am not sure how this processor will react to heavy games (please refer to reviews given by any gamers in this respect)<br>\n<br>\nIn short, for a person like me who wants to use a phone like a phone plus at the same time wants ALL Android features, Buy this phone, it wont disappoint.<br>\nThe biggest achievement is it beats all those mediocre phones in 12-15k range!!<br>\n<br>\nWe were being fooled by these phone companies till now, MotoE is loyal to its customers and gives respect to them by giving superior features in this affordable price range!<br>\n<br>\nCome to think of it, If I could live with my stupid LG (12k) phone and dad's Samsung Ace plus (15k) for two years, I will be more than happy if this 7k lasts for the same time!<br>\n<br>\nSo dont think on it, go for it. Save the money for better and meaningful things in life (like your education or any other essential electronic!)<br>\nMove away from the consumerist/materialistic picture Samsung and Iphones paint which makes u to believe you can have the best only by spending 35k or 40k!!!<br>\n<br>\nAmen! <br>\n<br>\nP.S. This is revolution! Getting all these features and 1GB RAM at Rs.7000 proves that good technology can be affordable and can have mass appeal! <br>\n                                   </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    Someone mentioned here that SAR value is high, so I though of checking it up on motorola site, and below text is copy paste from their site for Moto-E<br>\n<br>\n\" The highest SAR value for this model phone when tested for use at the ear is .76 W/kg*** While there may be differences between the SAR levels of various phones and at various positions, they all meet the governmental requirements for safe exposure\"<br>\n<br>\nSource: http://rfhealth-sar.motorola.com/SAR/english/sarEnglish-results.jsp?standard=ICNIRP-1&amp;prodid=Moto+E+-+XT1022                                </span>", "<span class=\"review-text\">\n                                    ...Review are given above somethng wrong but product is really very nyc..it cost 7k bt looks like more than 11k....<br>\nsuperb build quality n function given in mob are working very smooth <br>\ni bought it for my Daddy....cz of rough n very tough use of mob in my Dad pocket with keys nd other rough material.....this phone with Gorrila glass 3 wd smudge proof coating full fill the very much need of my dad expect working....<br>\nFirst it has android 4.4.2 kitkat ver. in 7k which is cheapest ever wd gaurantee update to higher ver. when comes.....<br>\n<br>\nit's design look brilliant and ultra fast 1.2 ghz QCmm dual core CPU<br>\n+<br>\n400Mhz Andreno302 GPU(more faster than lumia series n canvas magnus)  +<br>\n DDR2 1 GB RAM <br>\nhas great working capacity wd whole 1.5 day battery back up <br>\n<br>\nnd very very clear edge disply of 225ppi wd qHD of 720p resolution <br>\nvideo play back 89* angel <br>\nveiw has a very decent apperance nd protectiiing glass GG3<br>\n******<br>\n******<br>\nReview related to it that its has Wifi hotspot n tethring option <br>\n.........Don't wrry guys the news is very appreciable that it is fully functioned wd Bluetooth hotspot n USB+ wifi tethring....<br>\n<br>\nI like to buy motorola phone that perspect a good brand value<br>\n*****Old is Gold****<br>\n<br>\nCamera quality is pretty good as well as HRD ....<br>\n<br>\nMicro sim slot as usual ....<br>\nsound quality is so much pretty.....Motorola  is well known for its soung quality<br>\nhandling is so wd ease <br>\ndecent look wd pure white colour nd mxxt wd changable back cover(offer has 50% discout)<br>\n<br>\nGPU(400Mhz)...+ 1 GB ram helps it to multitaking wd so ease n fun .their is no lags or slow down whole day working...battery end up to 50% after exccesive use(wifi+3g netwrk+surfing+gaming+video playback)<br>\n<br>\nHigh HD gaming experiance (it has some lags in  super ending game like Nova3,Alfaults 8,,,,which requires more than 450mhz dual core GPU...cost more than 20k...what do u expect in 7k...which give much more u need)<br>\n<br>\nSuper navigation system nd a cute white light notification<br>\n<br>\nFinally......

You Max get 4 inches screen for 7K ( Sony Xperia E &amp; Samsung Galaxy pro in comparision).<br>\n2) Kitkat O.S just for 7k?

Its good on that range ,, Even Now a days every one carries Power bank as back-up...<br>\n6) The Design &amp; look is too good. Motorola Rocks..<br>\n7) And finally its Motorolla ....

Playing games, browsing web, locate places in google maps without any interrupts/slowness. <br>\n- After full charge, till now ( close to 6hrs), charge is 78% - wifi on, couple of youtube videos, email sync every 5 mins.
